Guess Master 3.0 This program is a game where the user is presented with a 4 to 6 letter secret word, and the user has 10 tries to guess the word. Each time the user guess the word, a new round will begin and the user's score will increase by 1. 

3 distinct features are:

1. Final guess which let the user type in the secret word, and goes to the next round if they guessed it correctly.
2. Hangman Mode, which let the user play the game in the style of hangman, where the programs draw the hangman, instead of dropping polygons.
3. Bonus scores, which lets the user play a minigame when they enter every 10th round, and will be awarded with 20 points if they won.
